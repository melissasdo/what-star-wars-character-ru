# Welcome to Which Star Wars Character Are You

This web page determines which Star Wars character you are based on two options: if the sum of your mobile battery percentage + the last two digits of the year you are born are less than 83, you get a character whose id matches your result. Otherwise, I'll just give you a random character.
